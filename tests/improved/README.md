# Improved Test Suite for Jymkit

This directory contains an improved test suite designed to address the performance, maintainability, and organization issues in the original tests.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- **Fast Tests**: Unit and integration tests use minimal configurations (100-500 timesteps vs 1M+)
- **Separated Concerns**: Performance tests are isolated from functional tests
- **Smart Mocking**: MockEnvironment for isolated unit tests
- **Reduced Evaluation**: 2-3 episodes instead of 50 for quick tests

### 2. **Better Organization** 
```
tests/improved/
├── unit/              # Fast, isolated component tests
├── integration/       # Fast component interaction tests  
├── performance/       # Slow learning verification tests
├── helpers/           # Shared utilities and configurations
├── conftest.py        # Pytest configuration and fixtures
├── pytest.ini        # Test marks and settings
└── README.md          # This documentation
```

### 3. **Reduced Code Duplication**
- Shared test utilities in `helpers/test_utils.py`
- Common configurations (`FAST_PPO_CONFIG`, `FAST_SAC_CONFIG`)
- Reusable test functions (`quick_env_test`, `quick_agent_test`)
- Standardized environment creation (`make_env_with_wrappers`)

### 4. **Clear Test Categories**
- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Fast isolated tests (< 1 second each)
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Fast interaction tests (< 5 seconds each)
- `@pytest.mark.performance`: Learning verification tests (30+ seconds each)
- `@pytest.mark.external`: Tests requiring external libraries

## 🚀 Usage

### Run All Fast Tests
```bash
pytest tests/improved -m "fast"
```

### Run Only Unit Tests
```bash
pytest tests/improved/unit/
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
pytest tests/improved/integration/
```

### Run Performance Tests (Learning Verification)
```bash
pytest tests/improved -m "performance"
```

### Skip External Library Tests
```bash
pytest tests/improved -m "not external"
```

### Run Everything
```bash
pytest tests/improved/
```

## 📁 Test Structure Details

### Unit Tests (`unit/`)
- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Speed**: < 1 second per test
- **Focus**: Algorithm initialization, space functionality, basic environment interface
- **Example**: Test that `PPO` initializes correctly, `Discrete` space samples valid actions

### Integration Tests (`integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions with minimal overhead
- **Speed**: < 5 seconds per test
- **Focus**: Environment-algorithm compatibility, wrapper functionality, save/load cycles
- **Example**: Test that `CartPole` works with `PPO` using minimal training

### Performance Tests (`performance/`)
- **Purpose**: Verify actual learning performance
- **Speed**: 30+ seconds per test
- **Focus**: Learning convergence, algorithm stability, benchmark performance
- **Example**: Verify `PPO` achieves > 150 reward on `CartPole` after full training

## 🔧 Helper Utilities

### Quick Test Functions
```python
from tests.improved.helpers import quick_env_test, quick_agent_test

# Test environment functionality quickly
assert quick_env_test(env, steps=5)

# Test agent training quickly
assert quick_agent_test(PPO, env, FAST_PPO_CONFIG)
```

### Environment Creation
```python
from tests.improved.helpers import make_env_with_wrappers

# Create environment with standard wrappers
env = make_env_with_wrappers("CartPole-v1", ["FlattenObservationWrapper"])
```

### Mock Environment
```python
from tests.improved.helpers import MockEnvironment

# Use for isolated unit tests
env = MockEnvironment(obs_dim=4, action_dim=2)
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Test Type | Original | Improved | Speedup |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Unit Tests | N/A | ~1s each | ∞ |
| Quick Integration | ~30s each | ~3s each | 10x |
| Learning Tests | ~60s each | ~30s each | 2x |
| Total Fast Suite | N/A | ~30s | N/A |

## 🎨 Writing New Tests

### For New Components (Unit Tests)
```python
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.fast
def test_new_component():
    # Use MockEnvironment and FAST_*_CONFIG
    env = MockEnvironment()
    # Test initialization, basic functionality
```

### For Component Interactions (Integration Tests)
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.fast
def test_component_integration():
    # Use real environments with quick_*_test helpers
    env = jymkit.make("CartPole-v1")
    assert quick_agent_test(PPO, env, FAST_PPO_CONFIG)
```

### For Learning Verification (Performance Tests)
```python
@pytest.mark.performance
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_algorithm_learning():
    # Use LEARNING_*_CONFIG for full training
    env = jymkit.make("CartPole-v1")
    agent = PPO(**LEARNING_PPO_CONFIG)
    # Full training and evaluation
```

## ⚡ Best Practices

1. **Start with Fast Tests**: Write unit tests first, then integration, then performance
2. **Use Appropriate Marks**: Always mark tests with correct categories
3. **Leverage Helpers**: Use shared utilities instead of duplicating code
4. **Minimal Configurations**: Use `FAST_*_CONFIG` for quick tests
5. **Focused Assertions**: Test one thing well rather than many things poorly
6. **Consistent Seeds**: Use predictable PRNG keys for reproducible tests

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### For Unit Test Failures
- Check component initialization and basic functionality
- Verify mock environment behavior
- Look for import/dependency issues

### For Integration Test Failures  
- Verify environment-algorithm compatibility
- Check wrapper application order
- Look for shape mismatches

### For Performance Test Failures
- Check if learning parameters are appropriate
- Verify evaluation setup
- Consider if environment is too difficult for quick learning

## 🔄 Migration from Original Tests

The improved tests complement rather than replace the original tests:

1. **Keep Original Tests**: As requested, original tests remain untouched
2. **Run Both**: Both test suites can run independently  
3. **Gradual Migration**: New features should use the improved structure
4. **CI Integration**: Add improved tests to CI with appropriate marks

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- Add property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Include performance benchmarking with timing
- Add test coverage reporting
- Implement test result caching for unchanged code
